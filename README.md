### Grade Sheet


[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/uc-soit/individual-assignment-1-my-class-journal-jeremylshepherd/tree/master.svg?style=shield&circle-token=f86280a925e7ed78bd6399fae5252d65813f7cd8)](https://circleci.com/gh/uc-soit/individual-assignment-1-my-class-journal-jeremylshepherd/tree/master)


Complete this grade sheet and submit it under the Assignments tab in Blackboard.  The grade sheet and GitHub URL are the only things that you need to submit under the Assignments tab.  I will access your source code on your GitHub repository.  You can clone the project into your own private repository, using this link: https://classroom.github.com/a/Uv7U0UQR (Links to an external site.)   (Links to an external site.)and then commit and push your work to GitHub.  All work must be committed and pushed to GitHub by the due date.

**Important**: GitHub classrooms will create a feedback branch.  I need this branch to grade your project.  
1) Do not delete or merge the feedback branch.  
2) Use the repository created for you by GitHub classrooms.  Do not fork or clone this into a different repository, as you will lose the feedback branch if you do that.  If there is not a feedback branch, I will not be able to grade your project, and it will receive a default grade of "0".

On this grade sheet, enter the points that you would award yourself for each of the items below.

- 10/10: The task is 100% complete.
- Something between 6 and 9 out of 10: the task is partially complete.
- 5/10: You did not attempt this task, do not want it to be graded, and are willing to accept 5/10 credit for the task.
- A note, if you assign yourself more than 5/10 for a task that is not completed, or you do not submit this grade sheet, I will count the score as 0/10.

#### Timeliness
Program turned in on time?

Days late: _0_ X 10% penalty per day: _0_

* No credit is given for projects turned in more than 4 days late.

* The submission date is the date that all files are committed and pushed to GitHub.
